# MPAR-Framework

Project in progress.

A framework that allows multiuser interaction with virtual object in AR such as object manipulation, using Unityâ€™s new built-in Networking solution, Netcode for GameObjects (FKA MLAPI). It includes a chat system that allows communication between clients and hosts. The current research stage hypothesizes possible solutions to hologram & next-generation AR applications with Multiplayer.

The specification of this project is still under development which may result in changes.
